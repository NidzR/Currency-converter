# Currency-converter
 Streamlit

Key improvements made:
1. Translated all UI text to English
2. Added error handling for API requests
3. Improved number formatting with commas
4. Added currency symbols (ðŸ’°) for better visual feedback
5. Included more specific error messages
6. Used proper variable naming (converted_amount instead of just converted)

To run this, you'll need these packages:
```
streamlit>=1.32.0
requests>=2.31.0
```

The app will:
1. Show a clean English interface
2. Handle API errors gracefully
3. Display properly formatted currency amounts
4. Work with the same exchange rate API as before

Note: You might want to consider:
1. Adding a loading spinner during API calls
2. Caching the exchange rates to reduce API calls
3. Adding more currencies to the dropdown list
